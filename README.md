vex-2014
========

This was a collection of the code written by the teams of the El Segundo High School Robotics Club for the 2014 Vex Robotics Challenge, divided by folders per team.  The folders hold not only source code, but documents, photos, and any other files the teams used for collaboration.

Our eventual goal (that this code would expand to hold code for every future ESHS VEX team) was realized in https://github.com/eshsrobotics/vex.
